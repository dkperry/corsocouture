            <h1>World Class</h1>
            <p>At Corso Couture, we strive to breed nothing but the finest, world class Cane Corso. What does it mean to breed a world class Cane Corso? To produce such a dog means taking special care to ensure everything from proper temperament to specific breed standards such as size, shape, and special markings. Our kennel purposefully plans only a few litters per year. We do this to ensure that our pups have all the attention and care needed in the first months of their lives so they have the best chance at a healthy, happy future.</p>

          	<h2>Standards</h2>
          	<p>Breed standard calls for the Cane Corso to be very gentle, docile, and loving with family members, especially children, but are fierce protectors and watch dogs. That is why we here at Corso Couture breed pups to be a part of your family, not to be kept in a kennel. Therefore, it is essential that proper socialization is a part of your petâ€™s life for the duration of your relationship. A properly socialized Cane Corso will be confident and valorous, while maintaining a gentle and loving composure towards its family. Since Cane Corso are especially wonderful and patient with children, they are consistently rated one of the top family dog breeds. Always remember though, your actions and attitude towards your pet will determine how well it interacts with others, so proper education and training is essential as is with any breed of dog.</p>

            <h2>Puppy Owners</h2>
            <p>Corso Couture believes in educating everyone to the fullest before they purchase a puppy. Part of owning a healthy, happy dog is taking the time to train and educate your puppy so they can be a productive member of your family. We are so passionate about this aspect of breeding that we begin the education process by beginning the crate training process for your puppy before you take him or her home, and we encourage you to keep this process up. It is our personal promise to you that we will do everything we can in the weeks prior to acquisition to ensure that he or she is as well adjusted to your family as possible.</p>

            <p>We encourage all our potential puppy owners to do thorough research to determine if this breed is right for you and your family. We are more than happy to answer any and all questions regarding your new family member. We are always available to our puppy owners, even after purchase. Our hope that, should you decide that this incredible dog is a great fit for your family, you will utilize our wealth of knowledge so that you will find that owning a Cane Corso is nothing short of rewarding and exciting!</p>
