              <h2>We are Corso Couture The Perry Family</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Corso Couture Kennels was founded by Daniel and Tamara Perry in 2012 when they acquired their first Cane Corso Mastiff. We are located in Nashville, TN and actively have 5 Cane Corso in our breeding program.</p>

            <p>Tamara is an at home mother to our two children, Taziah and Sebastien, and manages Corso Couture Kennels and Perry Investment Group. Since the acquisition of her first Cane Corso, Tamara has found it her passion and made it her mission to further her knowledge and extensively study this breed. She has gathered a wealth of knowledge on topics such as insemination, whelping, early puppy development, and dog training. She is excited about reviving this rare breed of dog and sharing it with the world.</p>

            <p>Daniel is a Software Developer with Metro Nashville and was thrust into the world of Cane Corso when he married Tamara in 2014. He is the driving force behind much of our marketing and is the leading designer of both CorsoCouture.com and Facebook.com/CorsoCouture. Since becoming involved with Cane Corso upon meeting Tamara, he too has developed an intense passion for breeding, but his area of expertise comes in training, proper socialization and showing.</p>

            <p>We consider our dogs members of our family, therefore they live in the home with us, and all litters are whelped in our home unless medical intervention is necessary. We have some of the finest vets and breeders at our disposal to ensure each puppy is given the best opportunity at a happy and healthy life. We also have a large family, so each puppy is thoroughly socialized to ensure a smooth transition into your home. Please donâ€™t hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you would like to see our home, kennel, dogs or puppies! Our family would love to meet yours!</p>
