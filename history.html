              <h1>History of the Cane Corso</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <h2>Origin</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>The Cane Corso Mastiff is a very distinct type of Italian Mastiff that is closely related to the Neopolitan Mastiff. However, the Cane Corso predates the Neoplitan Mastiff and is considered one of the last of the coursing Mastiffs. It is a direct descendent of the Canis Pugnax, the famed dogs used by the ancient Romans in warfare. The name ‘Cane Corso’ is derived from cane da corso, the name used to describe the catch dogs used in old world farms for a variety of tasks around the homestead. These tasks included but were not limited to protecting and herding cattle and swine, boar hunting, and valorous actions such as bear fighting, cougar fighting, and protecting farm land from intruders both animal and human. This breed was very common throughout old world Italy and held in very high regard for its gentle temperament while maintaining a bold, fearless countenance when necessary.</p>

              <h2>Loss of a Breed</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>There were many factors that attributed to the near-extinction of the breed, however two stand out more so than others. These were the decline in hunting of large game and the onset of World War 2. Since the Cane Corso had found its home mainly with farmers in the Italian countryside, the men that were called to arms were forced to leave the farming to the women and children. With the famine, poverty and national disasters that World War 2 brought with it, the Cane Corso quickly became an afterthought. The fate of the breed continued to worsen when the surviving, able bodied men who returned from war decided to pursue jobs in the north, leaving farm life, and the Cane Corso, in the past.</p>

              <h2>Growth of the Breed</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>The Cane Corso was first introduced in the U.S. in 1988 by Michael Sottile SR when he imported the first litter from Italy. He returned the following year and imported the second litter. However it wasn’t until 1993 that the International Cane Corso Federation (ICCF) was formed and served as the parent breed club and registry for this newly recognized breed with the Wilson’s and the Hoda’s serving as the heads. The Hoda’s and Wilson’s made a number of trips to Italy to secure more breeding stock to ensure the continuation of this almost extinct breed. Later in 2003, the ICCF sought to receive AKC recognition and in 2007 the Cane Corso breed was approved for the miscellaneous class. It wasn’t until 2010 that the Cane Corso received full breed recognition. Many people continue to work tirelessly to ensure the revival of this beautiful and wonderful dog and help the Cane Corso to be a flourishing breed once more.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Since the breeds revival in the late 1980’s, the breed is mainly recognized as a family companion and guard dog. It quickly becomes attached to its family, most notably and if not the most strongly to the children. They are particularly playful, patient, and overtly gentle natured towards children and this is a trait we strongly foster here at Corso Couture. We understand that children are a family’s most prized possession and we want to provide a pet that will not only protect that, but understand that as well. We strive to breed an accepting and loving spirit into each and every Corso. This means that they will get along seamlessly with other household pets as well. As the Cane Corso was in the old Italian country side, they are fierce protectors and desire to be with their family.</p>
